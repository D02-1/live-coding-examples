# UI-Basics Test: First Test
## General Instructions

* Work from the `index.html` file and a CSS stylesheet.

* You can use google, but you cannot ask your teacher/s or your classmates for help. 

* Good luck! 

## Test Instructions
### Starting Up
* Make and link a CSS stylesheet and work from there.

* Use positioning to fix the header to the top of the page. It should take up 100% of the available space and not cover any of the content below. Give the header a background color of **cyan**.

### Content Styling 
* In the "_List_" section, change the color of the second list item to blue.

* In the "_Images_" section, make all of the images appear side-by-side.

* Give three `h3` elements in the html document the same class. 

* Change the color of the `h3` elements to orange using rbg. The size of the text should be `2em` and appear as uppercase.

* Select all descendant links in the footer. Change the links' color to green on `visited` and red on `hover`.

### Box Model 
* In the "_Box Model_" section, add `5 pixels` of `padding` to the section element that contains a paragraph and an image.

* In the "_Box Model_" section, make sure the margins of the section element which contains a paragraph and an image is `10%` of its parent's width.

### Images & Links 
* In the "_Link_" section, insert a link that redirects the user to an image of your favourite book cover. Make sure that the image opens in a new tab.

* In the "_Images_" section, add the image `tree.jpg` from the image folder. Make the image appear rounded. Add [this](https://caseytrees.org/tree-species/) link to the `tree.jpg` image.

### Hierarchy
* Move the footer in HTML to the bottom of the document.
